                                                               **TERRAFORM PROJECT COMPLTE DESCRIPTION:** 
                                                                   
**INTRODUCTION:**    I AM GOING TO WRITE THIS TERRAFORM CODE TO CREATE A CUSTOM VPC WITH 2 SUBNETS ONE IS PRIVATE ANOTHER ONE IS PUBLIC ALSO CREATE AN 
INTERNET GATEWAY TO ATTACH WITH PUBLIC SUBNET. THEN I CREATE A ROUTING TABLE AND ASSOCIATING WITH PUBLIC SUBNET. I ALSO CREATE A TWO SECURITY GORUP ONE 
FOR PUBLIC AND THE OTHER ONE IS FOR PRIVATE ACCESS. FINALLY I CREATE 2 EC2 INSTANCES AND DEPLOYING ONE EC2 INSTANCE IN PUBLIC SUBNET AND ANOTHER ONE IS 
IN PRIVATE SUBNET.

**DESCRIPTION:**    AT FIRST I AM GOING TO CREATE **MAIN.TF** FILE AND INSIDE OF THIS FILE TO DEFINE THE INFORMATION ABOUT "PROVIDER" AND "RESOURCES"

**PROVIDER:**        I DEFINE THE PROVIDER AS AN AWS AND ALSO CHOOSE THE REGION WHERE TO DEPLOY ALL THE RESOURCES BY USING TERRAFORM. FINALLY GENERATE 
THE ACCESS KEY AND SECRET ACCESS KEY FROM THE MANAGENEMT CONSOLE THAT ALLOW TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTIO BETWEEN AWS PROVIDER AND TERRAFORM.

**RESOURCE 01:**     I CREATE A CUSTOM VPC AND DEFINE THE CIDIR BOLCK WITH $$VARIABLE SO THAT IF I WANT TO CUSTOMIZE THE CIDIR BOLCK (RANGE OF THE IP ADDRESS)
IN THE FUTURE THEN EASILY CAN BE ABLE TO CHANGE FROM THE VARIABLE FILE MEANS I DONT NEED TO CHANGE THE VALUE OF THE CIDIR BLOCK FROM THE RESOURCES.

**RESOURCE 02:**     I CREATE AN INTERNET GATEWAY AND ATTACH IT WITH THE CUSTOM VPC AND THAT ALLOWS TO COMMUNICATE MY INSTNCE WITH OTHER SERVICES OVER THE INTERNET.

**RESOURCE 03:**     I CHOOSE THE AVILABILITY ZONE TO CREATE PUBLIC SUBNET BECAUSE SUBNET IS ALWAYS DEFINED IN THE AZ AND ALSO PROVIDE THE VALUE OF CIDIR BLOCK
FOR THE SUBNET.

**RESOURCE 04:**     I CREATE A ROUTING TABLE TO DEFINE THE ROUTING PATH SO THAT INSTANCE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER RESOUCE ON THE SAME NETWORK (INSIDE OF VPC) AND ALSO DEFINE THE LOCAL ROUTE IF INSTANCE WANTS TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHE SERVER OVER THE INTERNET THEN TRAFFIC WILL GO THROUGH TO THE INTERNET-GATEWAY.

 **RESOURCE 05:**    FINALLY, I ATTACH THE PUBLIC SUBNET WITH THE ROUTING TABLE SO THAT ANY INSTANCE DEPLOYS IN THE PUBLIC SUBNET CAN ACCESS TO OTHER SERVER OVER
 THE INTERNET.

**RESOURCE 06:**     I CHOOSE DIFFERENT AVILABILITY ZONE TO CREATE PRIVATE SUBNET BECAUSE SUBNET IS ALWAYS DEFINED IN THE AZ AND ALSO PROVIDE THE VALUE OF CIDIR BLOCK
FOR THE SUBNET AND ANY INSTANCE DEPLOYS IN THE PRIVATE SUBNET ONLY CAN ACCESS TO THE OTHER RESOURCES IN THE VPC (MUST BE ON SAME NETWORK).

**RESOURCE 07:**
